# CLAUDE.md — Agentic Network Management and Automation (NMAS)

## Project Overview

Flask-based web application for managing, automating, and monitoring Cisco IOS
network devices. Built by Dustin Marchak as a capstone/school project. The app is
a single-host management tool — not a multi-tenant SaaS — so there is no built-in
auth system.

**Stack:** Python 3.10+, Flask, Flask-SocketIO, Netmiko/Paramiko (SSH), Anthropic
Claude API (AI agent), vis.js (topology), Bootstrap 5, Jenkins CI integration,
NetBox (source of truth).

The project is mid-way through a planned conversion into a Network Source of
Truth (NSoT) framework. **[docs/NSOT_PLAN.md](docs/NSOT_PLAN.md) is the governing
spec for that work** — read it before starting any NSoT phase. Phase 0 is
complete; Phases 1–5 are not started.

## Module map

Line counts are accurate as of Phase 0 (2026-09-20). Everything listed is
tracked in git.

### Core
- **[app.py](app.py)** (5,301) — Flask routes and SocketIO handlers. Monolithic
  by design for pre-existing features; **new routes go in `routes/` instead**.
- **[modules/ai_assistant.py](modules/ai_assistant.py)** (7,195) — AI agent core:
  tool definitions, `run_chat()`, golden config management, read-first workflow
- **[modules/agent_runner.py](modules/agent_runner.py)** (1,363) — background
  autonomous agent daemon; pauses when the user opens chat
- **[modules/netbox_client.py](modules/netbox_client.py)** (3,231) — NetBox
  IPAM/DCIM client. Reads freely; **writes are gated** (see below)
- **[modules/topology.py](modules/topology.py)** (1,207) — CDP/OSPF/BGP/DMVPN
  discovery; vis.js graph with hub/spoke labels
- **[modules/jenkins_runner.py](modules/jenkins_runner.py)** (1,196) — Jenkins
  pipeline create/trigger/poll/diagnose
- **[modules/pipeline.py](modules/pipeline.py)** (1,159) — 9-stage
  `PipelineRunner` (NetBox query → render → CI gate → snapshot → diff → deploy →
  snapshot → verify/rollback → audit). **Built but not wired into the UI**: only
  its audit-log readers are called from `app.py`. Phase 3 wires it in.
- **[modules/configure.py](modules/configure.py)** (1,093) — IOS config generator
  for 10 feature types; also generates Jenkins verification scripts and pipeline XML
- **[modules/pipeline_builder.py](modules/pipeline_builder.py)** (745) — Jenkins
  pipeline XML builder for per-function verification

### Collectors and checks
- **[modules/snmp_collector.py](modules/snmp_collector.py)** (763) — SNMP v1/v2c
  trap receiver + OID polling
- **[modules/netflow_collector.py](modules/netflow_collector.py)** (381)
- **[modules/check_runner.py](modules/check_runner.py)** (618) — standalone
  verification entry point invoked by Jenkins
- **[modules/drift_check.py](modules/drift_check.py)** (415) — drift checker
  needing no Claude API; diffs against golden config
- **[modules/collector_config.py](modules/collector_config.py)** (238) — per-list
  collector settings, including trap/NetFlow ports

### NSoT / Phase 0–3c additions
- **[modules/settings_schema.py](modules/settings_schema.py)** (314) — settings
  defaults, JSON Schema validation, and forward migration
- **[modules/netbox_guard.py](modules/netbox_guard.py)** (276) — NetBox write
  gate, dry-run preview, and created-object provenance
- **[modules/secrets_store.py](modules/secrets_store.py)** (150) — Fernet
  encryption-at-rest for settings secrets
- **[modules/jenkins_shell.py](modules/jenkins_shell.py)** (61) — `bat` vs `sh`
  step selection for generated pipelines
- **[modules/netbox_authz.py](modules/netbox_authz.py)** — one-shot write
  authorization: plan hashing and single-use tokens
- **[modules/inventory/](modules/inventory/)** — per-list inventory source, the
  NetBox→device-dict adapter, and the cache that makes dispatch I/O-free
- **[modules/credentials.py](modules/credentials.py)** — encrypted credential
  profiles and the resolver
- **[modules/nsot/context.py](modules/nsot/context.py)** — `build_render_context()`,
  the single way templates get data
- **[modules/nsot/repo.py](modules/nsot/repo.py)** — `save_golden()`, the one
  golden write path; trailers, tags, renames, CI notes, locking
- **[modules/nsot/manifest.py](modules/nsot/manifest.py)** — identity map
  (`nb:<id>` / `uid:<uuid>`), pending renames, `sync_platforms()`
- **[modules/nsot/normalize.py](modules/nsot/normalize.py)** — every
  config-line filter, one per job
- **[modules/nsot/migrate.py](modules/nsot/migrate.py)** — dry-run-first
  migration with duplicate merging; one-shot, guarded by `.nsot/migrated.json`
- **[modules/nsot/restore.py](modules/nsot/restore.py)** — baseline restore,
  skipping stale devices
- **[modules/nsot/hooks.py](modules/nsot/hooks.py)**,
  **[archive.py](modules/nsot/archive.py)** — background post-commit push/archive
- **[modules/nsot/parsers/](modules/nsot/parsers/)** — config → host_vars, one
  module per platform (`cisco_ios.py`, `cisco_iosxe.py`)
- **[modules/nsot/roundtrip.py](modules/nsot/roundtrip.py)** — render vs. real,
  ordering policy, coverage report
- **[modules/nsot/hostvars.py](modules/nsot/hostvars.py)** — YAML staging,
  secret handoff
- **[modules/nsot/ifnames.py](modules/nsot/ifnames.py)** — canonical interface names
- **[modules/nsot/render_artifact.py](modules/nsot/render_artifact.py)** — the
  deployability gate; frozen, computed, no override
- **[modules/nsot/templates_repo.py](modules/nsot/templates_repo.py)** — the
  per-network template library and bindings
- **[modules/nsot/approval.py](modules/nsot/approval.py)** — template approval
  keyed on a binding fingerprint
- **[modules/nsot/deploy.py](modules/nsot/deploy.py)** — the deploy contract,
  merge-only diff, transport, circuit breaker, batch orchestration
- **[modules/nsot/convergence.py](modules/nsot/convergence.py)** — per-protocol
  settle windows
- **[modules/integrations/](modules/integrations/)** — one client per external
  tool (NetBox, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Oxidized, Kea, topology service, NSoT
  git, S3). Phase 0 ships `test_connection()` only; Phase 5 adds read clients.
- **[routes/](routes/)** — Flask blueprints: `settings_integrations.py`,
  `netbox_safety.py`, `inventory.py`, `golden.py`, `templatize.py`,
  `templates.py`, `deploy.py`

### Other
`approval_queue.py`, `config_git.py`, `device.py`, `connection.py`, `bulk_ops.py`,
`backups.py`, `variable_discovery.py`, `event_monitor.py`, `ccie_kb.py`,
`terminal.py`, `commands.py`, `agent_timers.py`, `ai_usage_log.py`, `quick_actions.py`,
`utils.py`, `config.py`

### Templates
`base.html` (2,442 — layout + AI chat panel), `index.html` (8,045 — main
dashboard), `device.html` (1,239 — per-device page), and
`templates/partials/` for new UI.

## Key Architecture Decisions

- **Data storage:** `data/lists/{slug}/` per device list — devices.csv
  (Fernet-encrypted creds), variables.json, golden_configs/, backups/,
  approval_queue.json, jenkins_pipelines.json, config_repo/
- **Migration is one-directional and runs once.** `config_repo/golden/` is the
  golden store; `golden_configs/` survives as a deprecated **read-only**
  fallback, consulted by `_find_golden_config_file()` only when the manifest has
  no entry for a device. It is never an input to migration again, and nothing
  writes there. `apply()` refuses when `.nsot/migrated.json` exists (`409`), and
  independently of that guard cannot produce an empty commit.
- **Platform lives in the manifest, sourced from the inventory.** The `platform`
  CSV column (local lists) or the NetBox platform slug (NetBox lists), resolved
  through `platform_for_device()` and refreshed by `manifest.sync_platforms()`
  on every inventory change — not only at migration.
- **AI read-first:** the agent checks golden configs and variables before opening
  any SSH session
- **Config push workflow:** backup → push → Jenkins CI → save golden → update
  variables. CI pass = auto-approve.
- **Approval queue:** destructive AI actions go through `approval_queue.py`
- **Connection pool:** Netmiko SSH connections reused via `modules/connection.py`;
  background ping worker tracks online/offline
- **Auto-continue:** the AI agent loops tool calls until the task completes
- **telnetlib shim:** `telnetlib.py` in root — Python 3.13 removed it from stdlib

### NetBox write safety (Phase 0)

NetBox reads are unrestricted. **Writes are fail-closed** and go through exactly
three chokepoints in `netbox_client.py`: `_nb_post`, `_nb_patch`, `_nb_delete`.

Two independent conditions must both hold before any write executes:

1. `netbox_allow_writes` — the **master switch**, meaning "this instance may
   write to NetBox at all". Defaults off. A persistent operator decision; it is
   never flipped as a side effect of confirming an operation.
2. A **single-use authorization token** (`modules/netbox_authz.py`) issued by a
   preview and bound to a hash of that exact plan.

- **Import and Remove still work.** Clicking either runs a read-only dry run
  (allowed regardless of the gate, since it writes nothing) and shows a preview
  of every object that would change.
- **Confirming is one-shot.** Execute consumes the token, recomputes the plan,
  and aborts with "NetBox changed since preview" if the hash differs. Tokens
  expire in 5 minutes and are burned even on a failed validation, so they cannot
  be replayed.
- **The preview count is the executed count**, including dependent objects under
  a device that does not exist yet (placeholder ids) and shared objects counted
  once rather than once per device.
- Every object NMAS **creates** is tagged `nmas-managed` and its id recorded in
  `data/netbox_created_ids.json`. Objects NMAS merely updates are never tagged —
  the tag is injected in `_nb_post` only, never `_nb_patch`.
- **Removal deletes only the intersection** of those two: tagged *and* in NMAS's
  own record. A region, site, VRF, or device a human curated is reported as
  skipped. Removal previously deleted everything in the site regardless of origin.
- Deleting a device list **no longer cascades into NetBox** unless
  `netbox_remove_on_list_delete` is on or the request opts in.

### Inventory sources (Phase 1)

A device list is either `local` (a CSV — the default, and what every
pre-existing list uses) or `netbox`, set per list in
`data/lists/{slug}/source.json`. An absent file means `local`.

- **`load_saved_devices()` is the single dispatch point.** It has ~79 call
  sites across 11 modules; routing the decision through it means bulk ops, the
  terminal, backups, drift, topology, the connection pool and the AI tools all
  work on a NetBox list without changes.
- **Dispatch never performs network I/O.** A background refresh queries NetBox
  and resolves + encrypts credentials once per refresh; dispatch serves finished
  dicts from memory. The adapter returns credentials **still Fernet-encrypted**,
  matching a CSV row, because callers decrypt at use.
- The last good inventory is persisted to `netbox_inventory_cache.json` —
  **identity only, never credentials** — so a restart during an outage still
  yields the last known list, badged stale. Credentials are re-resolved on
  rehydrate.
- **Identity is read-only.** CSV writers refuse, and the UI disables Add Device,
  Delete, Discover→Add and Refresh Hostnames with an "Edit in NetBox" tooltip.
  Drag-and-drop ordering still works, stored in `source.json`.

**Credential resolution** (`modules/credentials.py`), first match wins: device
override → the list's *designated* `credential_list` (one list, never a scan) →
role profile → site profile → default profile. Every device carries
`_cred_source` so the origin is visible. Deleting a designated credential list
warns about dependent lists; "Copy inherited credentials into device overrides"
decouples on demand.

**Incomplete NetBox data:** a device missing `primary_ip4`, an unmapped
platform, or unresolvable credentials is **skipped with a per-device reason**,
never failing the whole list. An unmapped *role* is only a warning — it resolves
to `""` and topology falls back to hostname inference. Set
`platform_default_netmiko_type` to trade a platform skip for a warning.

**Stale devices:** a device that vanishes from NetBox keeps its golden configs
and backups but becomes **inert** — the approval executor, drift checker, and AI
tools refuse to act on it, and its pooled SSH session is closed.

### Golden config repository (Phase 2)

`data/lists/{slug}/config_repo/` is the NSoT repo: `golden/<device>.cfg`,
`.nsot/manifest.json`, `infra/`, `.gitattributes`.

- **One write path.** Everything that promotes a golden config goes through
  `nsot.repo.save_golden()`. **One call is one commit**, even for a nine-device
  Save All. An unchanged device creates no commit but is still reported.
- **Identity is resolved, never minted by accident.** `resolve_identity()` takes
  the item's identity, else the manifest by IP, else by name — and mints only
  when `allow_new=True`. The pipeline passes `allow_new=False`: a deploy targets
  a device the inventory already knows, so arriving with no identity is a bug,
  not an onboarding. A function that creates identity when none is supplied
  always masks a caller that forgot to supply it.
- **Timestamps live in git**, not in the file. The file keeps one stable header
  line; `! Saved:` / `! Source:` are gone because they produced a diff on every
  save. Commits carry `Source`, `Actor`, `Device-Id`, `Device-Name` trailers,
  and annotated tags `golden/<device>/<UTC>` and `baseline/<UTC>`.
- **Identity, not filename.** The manifest keys on `nb:<netbox_id>` or
  `uid:<uuid4>`. A rename is a `git mv` committed **alone**, which is what keeps
  `git log --follow` working across it.
- **Refresh never writes to git.** An inventory refresh records
  `pending_rename` in the manifest only; the `git mv` happens at the next
  `save_golden` or via "Sync device names to repo". Both names resolve while
  pending.
- **Restore queues approvals**, never pushes. Stale devices are skipped and
  **named** in the confirm dialog.
- **Migration is dry-run by default.** It merges case-insensitive and IP-level
  duplicates keeping the newest content, reports every merge, and backs up
  rather than deletes.
- **Every commit that moves a device carries `.nsot/manifest.json`.** The
  rename commit stages `.nsot` alongside `golden`, so a clone or bundle restore
  at that commit resolves the new name instead of falling through to the legacy
  header scan. `save_templates()` deliberately does not touch the manifest.
- **`.gitignore` rules are applied on repo access, not only at creation.**
  `ensure_repo_hygiene()` runs from `git()`; `GITIGNORE_RULES` is the list. A
  repo created before a rule existed is topped up on first touch.
- Post-commit hooks (git push, S3 archive) run on a background thread with
  short timeouts and never block a commit. Push never force-pushes.
- `nsot_device_tag_retention` (default 50) prunes per-device tags only;
  `baseline/*` tags and all commits are kept.

**Config-line filters** live in `modules/nsot/normalize.py`. They are *not* one
list — four different jobs, and `push_safe_lines()` filtering `end` is a
truncation guard, not cleanup. `test_normalize_equivalence.py` pins each to its
prior behaviour.

### Templatization (Phase 3a)

Config → `host_vars` YAML → render → compare. **Read-only**: extractions go to
`config_repo/.nsot/staging/host_vars/` (gitignored); 3b adds the reviewed commit.

Current coverage across all nine reference devices (R1–R5, S1–S4):
**100% modeled, 100% round-trip fidelity, zero unmodeled constructs.**

Decision rule for what to model: **any construct appearing on 2+ devices, or
any routing/redundancy protocol in the network design.**
`test_fleet_coverage.py` enforces it.

- **One parser module per platform** (`cisco_ios`, `cisco_iosxe`). A new vendor
  is a new module plus a template directory — that is the multi-vendor story.
- **Secrets are hashes.** `enable secret 9 $9$…` has a per-hash salt and cannot
  be regenerated; the store holds the hash string and templates emit it
  verbatim. `secret_kind: hash` marks values Part 2's rotation must skip.
- **Ordered comparison by default.** Reordered ACLs / prefix-lists / route-maps
  / `ip sla` fail. The unordered allowlist covers only what the device treats
  as a set, plus interface bodies (IOS reorders those itself).
- **Interface names are canonicalized** on both sides (`Gi0/0` →
  `GigabitEthernet0/0`), including references inside lines.
- **Coverage is reported honestly**: `modeled_coverage` counts `unmodeled`
  against it; `round_trip_fidelity` is separate.
- `strip_for_roundtrip()` removes what a template *cannot render* — distinct
  from volatile.
- **Every volatile pattern anchors to column 0** unless listed in
  `NESTED_OK_PREFIXES`. `version 17.6` is the image version; `  version 2`
  under `router rip` is RIPv2. Stripping the latter from both sides of a
  comparison hid the loss entirely, so only extraction-side tests catch it.

### Template library and the deploy gate (Phase 3b)

`config_repo/templates/` holds the network's templates, seeded by copy from
`modules/nsot/templates/`. Templates are **per-platform**; per-device divergence
belongs in `host_vars`, with an explicit `bindings.yml` override as the
exception.

- **Nothing in 3b opens a socket.** Previews diff against captured artifacts
  only — a golden config and the newest stored backup, each labelled with its
  capture time. "Refresh capture" delegates to the existing backup route.
- **`deployable` is a computed property on a frozen dataclass.** A device with
  unmodelled constructs cannot reach a deployable render by any code path.
  `build_artifact()` is the only constructor and always validates.
- **`intended/` and previews are masked, so neither is ever a deploy source.**
  3c must re-render from the template with real secrets in memory;
  `assert_no_mask()` guards that path. Validation runs on the truthful render.
- **Unmodelled constructs can be acknowledged**, not dismissed: `unmodeled_ack`
  in `host_vars` must list the exact lines, is committed to git, and is
  invalidated by any new or removed unmodelled line.
- **Approval requires a clean round-trip against every bound device**, keyed on
  a binding fingerprint of **template hash + sorted bound identities**
  (scheme 2). Revoked by a template edit or a change to the device set —
  onboarding or removal. A device's *configuration* changing does not revoke
  it: that is `template_report`, live on every plan, per device, gating there
  with the lines named. Scheme 1 also hashed each device's host_vars, which
  meant a successful deploy revoked its own template's approval. Records carry
  a `scheme`; an older one is never silently honoured.
- Template commits use their own namespace (`template:`) and create **no tags**.
  **Seeding commits itself** (`template: seed library`), so an approval's diff
  is the approval rather than the whole library.

### Deploy from template (Phase 3c)

The only part of the NSoT work that reaches a device.

- **Intent is committed, never inferred.** `config_repo/host_vars/<device>.yml`
  is the only intent source on the deploy path; `.nsot/staging/host_vars/` is
  gitignored scratch. A device with no committed intent is `bootstrap` and
  **not deployable** — deriving intent from the device's own capture makes the
  diff empty by construction. A change is made by editing committed intent and
  committing it (`host_vars: <device> <summary>`), not by configuring the
  device and re-extracting.
- **Design rule — gate on template fidelity, never on intent drift.**
  `template_report` (render of the capture's own parse vs the capture) answers
  "can this template reproduce this device as it is"; if not, a render from
  intent is untrustworthy whatever the intent says, so it gates. `report`
  (render of committed intent vs the capture) is *drift* — the change being
  deployed — and gating on it would make every change block itself. Approval is
  keyed on capture-parsed host_vars for the same reason: it is a claim about
  the template, not about one device's intent.
- **Every pushed line is attributed before the confirm.** Merge-only pushes
  every line the render has and the device lacks, so anything that drifted on
  the device since the capture rides along. The plan renders the *previous*
  committed intent against the same capture and splits `to_add` into
  `from_this_edit` and `pre_existing`.
- **Secrets:** committed host_vars hold `secret_refs`; values live in the
  credential store. `write_committed()` refuses a `secrets:` mapping or any
  resolved value, checked structurally and by value. `hydrate_secrets()` is the
  only place names become values, in memory, at deploy time.

- **The 3b contract, in order**: refuse a non-deployable artifact → re-render
  with **real** secrets in memory → `assert_no_mask()` → only then connect.
  `intended/` is masked and is never read on this path.
- **Merge-only.** Missing lines are added; lines on the device the template does
  not mention are **removal warnings**, never negated. `assert_merge_only()`
  checks provenance rather than grepping for `no`, because a template may
  legitimately contain `no ip http server`.
- **What the operator confirms is what is sent, byte for byte** — not a
  superset, not a safe one. `merge_commands()` builds the exact program: each
  added line preceded by its full ancestor chain in order, one `exit` per open
  level at the end of each contiguous group, never `end`. The list is
  recomputed at apply and compared against the confirmed fingerprint; a
  mismatch is refused with "the device or intent changed since you confirmed".
  `PipelineContext.rendered_commands` **derives** from `confirmed_commands`
  when one is set — assigning over it raises `ConfirmedCommandsOverwritten`, so
  no stage can substitute its own render. `test_deploy_contract.py` runs the
  full pipeline with a spy transport and asserts the list reaching the wire is
  the list the plan published.
- **Transport is per platform.** `supports_netconf: false` goes straight to SSH
  with no attempt — not a fallback after a timeout.
- **`deployable` subsumes sendability.** `build_artifact()` measures
  non-printable bytes on the truthful render (never the masked one — the mask
  is U+2022) and `blocking_reasons` carries them, so there is one answer to
  "can this go out" rather than an artifact saying yes and `merge_commands()`
  saying no later.
- **Commands must be sendable.** `assert_sendable()` refuses any byte outside
  printable ASCII before connecting, and `hostvars.assert_printable()` refuses
  it at commit. An em dash is three UTF-8 bytes; IOS consumes the first, loses
  sync, and truncates the line, which surfaces as a Netmiko echo timeout rather
  than as an invalid character.
- **Rollback is computed, not replayed.** `rollback_commands()` inverts exactly
  what was pushed — re-send the old line where the pre-change config set the
  same thing differently, negate where it did not set it at all. A replay is a
  *merge* and cannot remove a line, so it could never undo a `shutdown`.
  `assert_rollback_provenance()` bounds the one place this tool generates `no`.
- **Rollback restores the device; the intent is separate.** A rollback records
  `.nsot/rolled_back.json` against the device's current intent commit, which
  blocks the next plan — otherwise it would propose exactly what just failed.
  The block is **containment, not equality**: it stands while the failed lines
  (each within its header chain) are still among the lines that would be sent,
  so an unrelated edit that adds its own sent line cannot bundle the failed
  change back out. Lifting it deliberately is `authorise_retry()`, an explicit
  recorded action. "Revert intent"
  (`POST /templatize/committed/<host>/revert`) applies the **inverse of that
  commit's own diff** onto current intent as a forward commit — keeping later
  unrelated commits, and refusing with the paths named when a later commit
  touched the same settings. A snapshot restore would either bring the
  rolled-back change back or discard the unrelated edit.
- **Reads never commit.** `ensure_repo_hygiene()` appends `.gitignore` rules on
  every `git()` call; only `init_repo()` commits the top-up, and it is reached
  solely from write paths.
- **Rollback fires whenever a push was attempted**, and targets every device
  not explicitly skipped — including one whose push failed mid-stream, which is
  the state most in need of restoring.
- **A failed push reports what landed.** `_capture_failure_state()` reads each
  attempted device back and diffs against the pre-change snapshot before any
  rollback. "The push failed" and "the device is unchanged" are different
  claims; a device that cannot be read reports `device_changed: None`.
- **Verification uses settle windows** (OSPF 45s, BGP 60s, RIP 90s) and reports
  *not yet converged* distinctly from *failed*. RIP is checked via the Routing
  Information Sources table; it was previously not checked at all.
- **Stage 8.5 saves golden** after verify, on partial success, from the
  post-deploy config stage 7 now captures.
- **Batch**: sequential by default, circuit breaker on repeated *verify*
  failures, drift skips rather than aborts, every device accounted for.

`/configure/apply` is untouched and remains the quick path.

### Settings

All settings live in `data/user_settings.json` with a `settings_schema_version`.
`modules/settings_schema.py` seeds defaults and migrates forward; old keys are
never deleted. **Every new default reproduces the behaviour that predates the
setting** — `netbox_allow_writes` is the one deliberate exception.

Secrets (API tokens, passwords, access keys) are encrypted at rest with the
existing Fernet key via `modules/secrets_store.py`. They are never logged, never
committed, and masked in the UI as write-only fields with a set/unset badge. The
NetBox token was previously stored in plaintext and is upgraded in place on first
run.

### Portability

Development is Windows 11; the deployment target is headless Ubuntu. See
[docs/DEPLOY_LINUX.md](docs/DEPLOY_LINUX.md).

| Setting | Env override | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Bind host | `NMAS_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` |
| Port | `NMAS_PORT` | `5000` |
| Auto-open browser | `NMAS_HEADLESS=1` disables | on |
| TFTP root | `NMAS_TFTP_ROOT` | `C:/TFTP-Root` on Windows, `/srv/tftp` elsewhere |
| Jenkins step shell | — | `bat` |

`config.py` no longer creates the TFTP root at import time. Call
`config.ensure_tftp_root()` at the point of use instead.

## Running the App

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py                      # opens http://127.0.0.1:5000
NMAS_HEADLESS=1 python app.py      # headless (no browser)
```

Settings (API key, integrations, Jenkins, TFTP, server bind) are all configurable
from the UI Settings panel — no restart needed except for bind host/port.

## Tests

```bash
pytest                    # 756 tests
pytest tests/test_netbox_write_gate.py -v
```

`pytest.ini` sets `pythonpath = .`, so both `pytest` and `python -m pytest` work
from the repo root. (Before Phase 0 only the latter did.)

All HTTP and SSH is mocked; **no test touches a live network.**

## Conventions

- New routes → `routes/` blueprints, registered by `routes.register_blueprints(app)`.
  `app.py` and `index.html` must not grow beyond registration and `{% include %}`.
- New UI → `templates/partials/`, Bootstrap 5 only, matching the existing card /
  tab / modal / badge patterns. No new CSS framework. Front-end libraries are
  vendored into `static/`, never loaded from a CDN (air-gapped networks).
- Return dicts shaped `{"ok": bool, "error": str, ...}`
- Module-level `log = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- Use `pathlib` / `os.path`, never hardcoded separators or drive letters
- **No IPv4 literals** in `modules/integrations/`, `modules/nsot/`, or `routes/` —
  `test_no_ip_literals.py` enforces this
- Fernet key at `data/key.key` — back it up; losing it makes stored credentials
  and secrets unrecoverable
- `.env` holds `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; excluded from git

## Things to Keep in Mind

- Jenkins pipelines default to Windows `bat` steps; switch to `sh` in Settings for
  a Linux Jenkins agent. Generated XML is byte-identical to pre-Phase-0 output
  while the default is unchanged.
- `telnetlib.py` shim must stay in the root for Python 3.13+ compatibility
- The app is intended for a trusted lab/management network — no auth layer. When
  exposing it, bind to a specific address behind a reverse proxy or tunnel.
- Silent failure is the dominant failure mode in this stack. Every integration
  call must log and surface its failures rather than swallowing them.
- `modules/pipeline.py` and `modules/pipeline_builder.py` are real, tested, and
  mostly unused. Don't mistake them for dead code — Phase 3 depends on them.

## Known defects deferred to later phases

Verified during Phase 0, deliberately not fixed yet. Recorded in full in
[docs/NSOT_WRITEUP_NOTES.md](docs/NSOT_WRITEUP_NOTES.md).
